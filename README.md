# TechBattle Name

This project consists of a backend built with Laravel and a frontend built with Create React App.

## Project Structure



## Backend

The backend is built with Laravel, a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your environment variables:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Generate an application key:
    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

4. Run the migrations:
    ```sh
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    php artisan serve
    ```

### Learning Laravel

Laravel has extensive [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and a video tutorial library at [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com).

### Contributing

Please review the [Code of Conduct](https://laravel.com/docs/contributions#code-of-conduct) and the [contribution guide](https://laravel.com/docs/contributions).

### License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
